# My-First-Unity-Game


### I started learning Unity on September 30th, 2023. 

### I'm using what I learn to build my first game, which I'll share in this public repository. 

### Right now, I'm also taking a Junior Programmer course on the Unity Learn website. 

### While this game is important to me, it's not my top priority in my learning journey. 

### I hope you'll check it out later once it's playable â€“ it'll be ready sooner than you might think!
