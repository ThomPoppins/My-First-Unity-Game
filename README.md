# My-First-Unity-Game


### I started learning Unity on September 30th, 2023, because I want to have fun while learning C#. 

### I'm using what I learn to make my first game, which I'll share with everyone once it's ready. 

### I'm also taking a course to become a better programmer with Unity and get certified. 

### While this game is important to me, it's not the main focus of my learning journey. 

### I hope you'll check it out later when it's playable â€“ it'll be ready sooner than you might think!
